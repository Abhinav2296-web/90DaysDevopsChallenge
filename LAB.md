### Task for Today:
1.	Go to our LinkedIn group.
2.	Create a post summarizing what you've learned so far â€” from Day 1 up to today (e.g., IAM, EC2, VPCs, NACLs, Linux permissions, etc.).
3.	Feel free to add:
    - Key takeaways
    - Any hands-on labs or screenshots
    - What you found interesting or challenging
4.	Tag me (@mohd-shahid-mohd) in your post.
5.	Use hashtags like:
```
