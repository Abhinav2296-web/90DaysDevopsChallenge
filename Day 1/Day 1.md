# Day 1: Introduction to DevOps and Cloud Computing

## What is DevOps?
- DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).
- It aims to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously.
- Key principles: Collaboration, Automation, Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), Monitoring.

## Why DevOps?
- Faster software delivery.
- Improved collaboration between teams.
- Increased deployment frequency and reliability.
- Enhanced security and compliance.

## Understanding Cloud Computing
- Cloud computing delivers computing services over the internet.
- Types of Cloud:
  - **Public Cloud** (AWS, Azure, GCP)
  - **Private Cloud** (On-premise, VMware, OpenStack)
  - **Hybrid Cloud** (Combination of both)

## Benefits of Cloud Computing
- Scalability: Resources can be scaled up/down as needed.
- Cost Efficiency: Pay for what you use.
- Security: Cloud providers ensure high security.
- Disaster Recovery: Cloud backups improve business continuity.

## DevOps vs Traditional IT
| Feature        | Traditional IT | DevOps |
|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Development & Ops Team | Separate | Integrated |
| Deployment Frequency | Low | High |
| Automation | Minimal | Extensive |
| Collaboration | Siloed | Continuous |

## Hands-on Activities
- Install Git and setup a GitHub repository.
- Create and push a simple project to GitHub.

## Homework
- Research about CI/CD and its importance in DevOps.
- Read about different cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
